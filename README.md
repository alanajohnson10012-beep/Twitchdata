This is a histogram of the distribution of the average viewers per channel. The distribution is heavily skewed right so I had to zoom in and limit some of the data. Most streamers have low average viewers, while a small number of channels reach extremely high averages.
After reviewing the Twitch dataset, I found that there were no missing values in any of the columns. Because of this, there was no need to remove or replace any observations. The histograms for “Average viewers” and “Watch time (Minutes)” did show a right-skewed distribution with a few very large outliers. However, these values represent real top-performing streamers rather than data errors. Since these high values are meaningful and reflect actual Twitch trends, I decided to keep all observations in the dataset.
