#This is a histogram of the distribution of the average viewers per channel. The distribution is heavily skewed right so I had to zoom in and limit some of the data. Most streamers have low average viewers, while a small number of channels reach extremely high averages.

#After reviewing the Twitch dataset, I found that there were no missing values in any of the columns. Because of this, there was no need to remove or replace any observations. The histograms for “Average viewers” and “Watch time (Minutes)” did show a right-skewed distribution with a few very large outliers. However, these values represent real top-performing streamers rather than data errors. Since these high values are meaningful and reflect actual Twitch trends, I decided to keep all observations in the dataset.

#For Watch Time (Minutes), the mean was 418,427,930, while the median was 234,990,788. The variance was 3.020992 × 10¹⁷, and the standard deviation was 549,635,514. The mean being much higher than the median shows that the data is right-skewed, meaning a few streamers have extremely high watch times that pull the mean upward. This suggests that most streamers have moderate to low watch times, while a small number of very popular channels dominate total viewership. The large standard deviation also indicates that the data is highly spread out, confirming that watch time varies widely across different streamers.

#The mean number of average viewers (4,781) is noticeably higher than the median (2,425). This again suggests right-skewness, where a few large channels with thousands of viewers raise the mean. The median gives a better sense of a “typical” streamer’s viewership.

#The standard deviation (8,453.69) is almost double the mean, showing that viewership numbers are very spread out. There’s a big difference between small and popular streamers. This high variation lines up with what we saw in the histogram from Milestone 3, where most values were clustered toward the low end with a long tail on the right.

#Before removing the outliers, the correlation between Average Viewers and Watch Time (Minutes) was 0.48, showing a moderate positive relationship. There were two really big outliers on the far right that stretched out the plot and made it harder to see the main pattern in the data.
After taking those outliers out, the new correlation went up to 0.65, which shows a moderately strong positive relationship. This means that as the average number of viewers increases, the total watch time also tends to go up. Removing those two extreme points made the scatterplot look more clear and gave a better picture of how the two variables are actually related for most streamers.
